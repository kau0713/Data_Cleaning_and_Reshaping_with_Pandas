# Data_Cleaning_and_Reshaping_with_Pandas

This project focuses on analyzing a candy hierarchy survey dataset from 2017, which contains responses on candy preferences, along with demographic data such as age, gender, and location. The dataset originally had 120 columns, including categorical responses on various candy types, as well as additional features like dress preferences and media consumption habits. After cleaning the data by removing duplicate entries and handling missing values, the dataset was reduced to 113 columns and 1781 rows. The main objective of this project was to explore the enjoyment levels associated with different candies based on demographic factors, particularly gender and age.

The analysis started with filtering and renaming columns for readability, followed by creating a hierarchical index using gender and age as primary keys. The enjoyment responses were then reshaped using stacking methods to streamline the dataset. Visualizations such as crosstabulations were created to display the frequencies of candy preferences categorized as “JOY,” “MEH,” or “DESPAIR.” Additional grouping and descriptive analysis provided insights into how location and age influence candy choices.

This project utilized Python with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, and the Excel files containing the 2017 survey data were imported for the analysis. Future enhancements to this project could include incorporating time series data by leveraging the 2015 dataset, which includes timestamp information, to observe trends over time. The candy_analysis.ipynb notebook in the repository demonstrates the full analysis and can be run to reproduce the results.
